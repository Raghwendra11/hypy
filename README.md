# hypy

Hypy is a Python 3.7 module for the interpretation of pumping test data. It allows to create diagnostic plots, and interpret the data with the most standard analytical solutions (Theis, Papadopulos-Cooper for large diameter wells, etc.).

The toolbox was developped by Loic Pianaro, and is based on a translation of the Hytool matlab toolbox :
