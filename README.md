# hypy

Hypy is a Python 3.7 module for the interpretation of pumping test data. It allows to create diagnostic plots, and interpret the data with the most standard analytical solutions (Theis, Papadopulos-Cooper for large diameter wells, etc.).

The jupyter notebooks that are provided with the module are demonstrating the application of the tools. If you want to use hypy, you should start by looking at the notebooks and adapt them to your case.

The toolbox was developped by **Loic Pianaro** for his Bachelor's thesis at the University of Neuchatel, and is based on the Hytool matlab toolbox : https://github.com/UniNE-CHYN/hytool 

If interested, you are welcome to participate in the extension or development of this open source project.
