# hypy

Hypy is a Python 3.7 module for the interpretation of pumping test data. It allows to create diagnostic plots, and interpret the data with the most standard analytical solutions (Theis, Papadopulos-Cooper for large diameter wells, etc.).

The jupyter notebooks that are provided with the module are demonstrating the application of the tools. If you want to use hypy, you should start by looking at the notebooks and adapt them to your case.

The toolbox was developped by Loic Pianaro, and is based on a translation of the Hytool matlab toolbox :
